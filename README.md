CharGen, short for *Charge Generation Function, is a dynamic mathematical model that captures the rate at which electric charge accumulates or discharges in a system over time. It is fundamentally expressed by the differential equation:

    dQ/dt = I + C * dV/dt

where Q(t) is the accumulated charge at time t, I is a constant or time-varying current in amperes, C is the capacitance in farads, and V(t) is the instantaneous voltage across the system. The term I represents direct current contributions, while C * dV/dt captures capacitive effects due to voltage changes. This equation is essential for analyzing systems where both current inputs and voltage dynamics influence how charge builds up or is depleted. It forms the foundation for understanding transient behaviors in various types of electrical components, especially where time-varying signals are involved.

CharGen is not entirely new in the sense of basic electrical theory—its roots lie in classical circuit analysis involving capacitors and time-domain behaviors. However, what makes CharGen innovative is the way it encapsulates these principles into a unifying, extensible function that can be customized for complex systems. By treating charge accumulation as a dynamic process influenced by both current injection and voltage-induced capacitive effects, CharGen offers a more holistic view of circuit dynamics. This is particularly useful for engineers and scientists who need to model real-world systems with higher fidelity than what traditional lumped parameter models allow. Its innovation lies in synthesizing diverse influences on charge behavior into a single, adaptable framework.

The potential applications of CharGen are vast and cross-disciplinary. In power electronics, it can model capacitor banks in energy storage systems, predict charging cycles in supercapacitors, or analyze the ripple behavior in power converters. In electrochemical domains like battery systems, fuel cells, and electrolyzers, CharGen can be extended to include ionic diffusion and electrochemical kinetics. For computing hardware, CharGen is useful in simulating charge retention in memory cells (like DRAM or flash), or the propagation of charge in advanced transistor designs. In short, any system where time-dependent voltage and current affect charge storage can benefit from this modeling function. It becomes especially powerful when paired with numerical methods like Euler integration or Runge-Kutta schemes to simulate complex behaviors over time.

CharGen can also be adapted to include non-ideal behaviors such as parasitic resistances, leakage currents, and temperature dependencies, making it highly versatile for real-world applications. Engineers may use it in multiphysics simulations that integrate electrical, thermal, and chemical effects—for example, in electric vehicle battery management systems or photovoltaic inverter design. The function serves as a mathematical bridge between theory and practice, providing a scalable and modifiable template for charge-based modeling. As electrical and electronic systems become increasingly integrated and complex, CharGen offers a much-needed tool to decode and predict time-dependent electrical behavior with both accuracy and flexibility.

CharGen can be extensively applied in power electronics, where it serves as a crucial analytical tool for modeling the dynamic behavior of capacitors and related components during charging and discharging cycles. In power supplies, for example, capacitors are used for smoothing output voltage and filtering noise, and CharGen helps predict how these capacitors respond to time-varying currents and voltages. The governing equation \( \frac{dQ}{dt} = I + C \frac{dV}{dt} \) allows engineers to evaluate how much charge is accumulated or lost over time under different load conditions. This is especially valuable in scenarios involving high-frequency switching, such as in DC-DC converters, where rapid transitions in voltage and current can produce complex transient responses. With proper numerical integration methods like Euler or Runge-Kutta, CharGen can be used to simulate real-time charge behavior and ensure system stability, optimize energy storage strategies, or even design efficient heat dissipation mechanisms in high-power systems.

Beyond electronics, CharGen finds significant use in electrochemical systems such as batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells. In these applications, charge accumulation isn't just electrical—it often reflects ionic transport through an electrolyte, electrode reactions, and even concentration gradients. By extending the CharGen framework to include these additional phenomena, such as Nernst diffusion or Butler–Volmer kinetics, researchers can develop highly accurate models of electrochemical storage devices. This is particularly important for optimizing battery charging protocols, understanding degradation mechanisms, or designing systems for maximum cycle life and performance. The CharGen function becomes a bridge between electrical input/output and the internal physical-chemical dynamics of these systems, enabling predictive simulations and control in energy storage, electric vehicles, and grid-level storage applications.
